    LOW PRIORITY
    > make map of Carintia study area
    > search for

# insert connection rate in fed states distribution


# apparently medium non nitrifying wwtps have been built after 1991
    > noe is checked
    > oebo WIS disapperad. wait and do the rest first

# questions for Gunter
    > OWAV states 17500 small WWTPS direkteineitung. 27540 if mech treatment is counted. what does this mean ?


# ARCHIVE
# create testing tool : >>>>> DONE
>check if data at the end = data at beginning
    >control is Gunters paper, except Oebo
    >eckdaten:
        >sum PE 260.500 + unterteilung Tab. 4
        >kind of technology Tab.2
    # RESULTS
        > all fine. just PE are strange. look further
        > data elaboration did not modify PE original. 
        > where is the error ? 

# create plottin tools:
    > make plotting more agile
    > think first
# heatmap
    > still don't know
# make nice graphs on distribution of WWTPs 
    > by BL, freq, outdated and so n
    > temporal graphs too
    >DONE

# CHECK original data with final
    > looks great. difference comes from absence of spatial reference

# create complete dataset. contains all, no mather if data missing 
    > DONE
# check half-way procedure 
    > make sure everything back to normal
    > rerun it 
    > change tyrol to tirol and carinthia to carintia

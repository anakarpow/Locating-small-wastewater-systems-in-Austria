### To do's

# resolution per KG and PG seems achieved
# identifying non-nitrifying wwtps seeems achieved
# start summarisiing and writing 
# then send to Gunter

# general question: how to manage KKA and <500 ???

# integrate tech_type
    > unify final geojson categories. how to ? columns ?
    > check with original
    > plot and analyse

# write results
    >add mean value in graphs 
    > add mean value popNoNitri in plot
    > add no_data pattern in plots 

# write interpretation
    >add some graphs as written
    >check legend of % nonnitri plot!!
    > consider further analisys carintia

# get KKA separate files
    >DONE
    > integrate in main workflow

# question Gunter
    > NOE unbekkant > i have way higher nr than publication
    >show control_data 
    > recheck unbekannt procedure !

# check control procedure
    > now is pure chaos!!!

### Status
# 6 BL reached final phase
    >plot and analyze
# 3 are missing
    >minor BLs, missing geo reference
    >what to do ?

# which scheme to use for plotting?
    > make some research !!

# ARCHIVE
# create testing tool : >>>>> DONE
>check if data at the end = data at beginning
    >control is Gunters paper, except Oebo
    >eckdaten:
        >sum PE 260.500 + unterteilung Tab. 4
        >kind of technology Tab.2
    # RESULTS
        > all fine. just PE are strange. look further
        > data elaboration did not modify PE original. 
        > where is the error ? 

# create plottin tools:
    > make plotting more agile
    > think first
# heatmap
    > still don't know
# make nice graphs on distribution of WWTPs 
    > by BL, freq, outdated and so n
    > temporal graphs too
    >DONE

# CHECK original data with final
    > looks great. difference comes from absence of spatial reference

# create complete dataset. contains all, no mather if data missing 
    > DONE
# check half-way procedure 
    > make sure everything back to normal
    > rerun it 
    > change tyrol to tirol and carinthia to carintia

### To do's
# questions for Gunter
    > OWAV states 17500 small WWTPS direkteineitung. 27540 if mech treatment is counted. what does this mean ?


# goals for next draft 
    > finish 
        >methods check!
        >fundamentals check!
        >first part of results to do
        >goals check!

# to do next
    > draft interpretation and conslusion 1.5h
        > insert cits in interpretation!!
    >  read everything and schek for consistency in : 
        > vocabulary especially design size categories. write what is small and what is medium. 1h
    


# before sending  to Gunter
    > think and rewrite results and discussion
    > draft the point analisys
        > recategorize in point_geo.py
        >connection to water quality?
        >time series?
    > warnings about :
        > graphs and plots only drafts. 
            >titles will be removed. grpahically optimized. legends checked and replaced. 
        > small and medium categories instead of PE anagabe

# QUESTION
    > point analisys
        >check data. especially primary after reg

# WRITING 
    HIGH PRIORITY
    > thoughly think on spatial analisys. what i want to show ? !!!!!!!!!!!!
    > goals : check and update if necessary
    > results ad discussion
        >revise with new graphs
        >add comments on size
    > methods : 
        >add approach ? 
        >revise data analisys?
    
    LOW PRIORITY
    > introduction : rewrite. read first!
    >interpretation : 
        >add!!
    > search for 
        > NGP Einzugsgebieten mit NÃ¤hrstoff Problematik map
        > small WWTPS are importnatn too. why?

# CODING

# insert connection rate in fed states distribution

# insert % in tech type bargraph

# add point coordinates study when available
    > how to visualize time series ?

# apparently medium non nitrifying wwtps have been built after 1991
    > noe is checked
    > oebo WIS disapperad. wait and do the rest first

# how many settlements smaller 2000PE rely only on small WWTPS?

# identify lost desing sizes in spatial datset chapter



# WRITING
# CODING

# examine settlements smanller than 2000PE

# write results
    >add mean value in graphs 
    >add mean value popNoNitri in plot

# all graphs and plots
    > remove title


### Status
# 6 BL reached final phase
    >plot and analyze
# 3 are missing
    >minor BLs, missing geo reference
    >what to do ?



# ARCHIVE
# create testing tool : >>>>> DONE
>check if data at the end = data at beginning
    >control is Gunters paper, except Oebo
    >eckdaten:
        >sum PE 260.500 + unterteilung Tab. 4
        >kind of technology Tab.2
    # RESULTS
        > all fine. just PE are strange. look further
        > data elaboration did not modify PE original. 
        > where is the error ? 

# create plottin tools:
    > make plotting more agile
    > think first
# heatmap
    > still don't know
# make nice graphs on distribution of WWTPs 
    > by BL, freq, outdated and so n
    > temporal graphs too
    >DONE

# CHECK original data with final
    > looks great. difference comes from absence of spatial reference

# create complete dataset. contains all, no mather if data missing 
    > DONE
# check half-way procedure 
    > make sure everything back to normal
    > rerun it 
    > change tyrol to tirol and carinthia to carintia
